## Acebook - Front End

This is the front end for our Facebook clone project done in week 8 - which can be found [here](https://github.com/hjpugh/acebook-PingPongAlmonds) - made using React.

## Instructions for Use

First make a copy of this repo:

```
	git clone  https://github.com/hjpugh/acebook-react-frontend.git
```

Then cd into the directory and run:

```
	npm install
```

And then:

```
	npm start
```

There is still a fair bit of work to be done here optimising etc.
